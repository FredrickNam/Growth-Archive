This project focuses on implementing deep learning algorithms from scratch.
Learning about DL **without using high-level libraries**, based on the book by **Koki Saito**.

> **Note:**
> **Chapters 01 & 02 (Python Basics & Perceptron Basics)** were reviewed for prerequisite knowledge but are not included in this repository.

## ⚖️ Copyright & License Compliance

Originally, my personal study logs were thoroughly documented in `.ipynb` format. However, to strictly comply with **Hanbit Media's copyright guidelines**, this repository only contains a highly compressed and summarized version of my original notes.

* **Non-Profit Use:** This archive is purely for personal study and portfolio purposes.
* **Content Limit:** The summarized content strictly does not exceed 30% of the original book's volume.

## 📂 Directory Structure & Execution Notice

The study materials are organized by **Chapters**, and further divided into individual `.py` scripts for each section.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**
Because these `.py` files are fragmented pieces extracted from my comprehensive study notes, **they are not guaranteed to execute independently.** They serve primarily as an archive of my understanding and implementation of core DL concepts.
